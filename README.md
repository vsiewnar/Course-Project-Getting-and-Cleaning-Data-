## Readme

* This repository contains two files: an R script and a markdown file. 

* The Rscript file is named 'run_analysis.R'. It assumes that the current directory is the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder which was obtained from 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'. When run, the R script produces a txt file containing the mean values of several means and standard deviations.

* The markdown file is named 'CodeBook.md'. It contains information about the variables used in 'run_analysis.R'.
